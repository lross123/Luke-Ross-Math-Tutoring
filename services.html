      <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;">Free 30‑Minute Consultation</h3>
      <p>
        Every new student begins with a complimentary consultation. During this session
        we’ll discuss your current level, strengths and challenges, set goals for
        improvement and look at how our lessons will be structured. It’s a chance for
        you to ask questions and for us to ensure we’re a good match. There’s no
        obligation to continue, but if you’re happy to proceed we’ll agree a schedule
        that works for you.
