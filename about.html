      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Luke</strong> and I’ve been passionate about mathematics for as long as
        I can remember. After achieving an Upper Second Class degree in
        <em>Mathematics with Economics</em> from Loughborough University and completing an
        MSc in <em>Biomedical Engineering</em> at the University of Warwick, I realised that I
        get just as much joy from helping others understand maths as I do from using it
        in my own research. What began as assisting classmates quickly turned into a
        rewarding career as a private tutor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past five years I’ve worked with dozens of students across GCSE,
        A‑Level and university programmes. Many were struggling with confidence or
        missed foundational concepts; others needed stretching and challenge to achieve
        top grades. I pride myself on being adaptable – whether your goal is to pass a
        resit or to aim for an A*, I will meet you where you are and build a plan to
        get you where you want to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tutoring I remain active in mathematical biology, applying
        stochastic processes and data science to better understand tissue growth and
        complex systems. This work keeps my analytical skills sharp and ensures I stay
        current with modern mathematical methods that often find their way into my
        teaching.
      </p>

      <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        My approach centres on clarity, patience and building confidence. I believe that
        everyone can succeed at maths with the right guidance and enough practice. To
        that end, I:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left:1.5rem; list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Break down complex topics into understandable steps, using simple language and visual aids.</li>
        <li>Encourage active participation through problem solving rather than passive listening.</li>
        <li>Provide plenty of exam‑style questions and feedback to reinforce learning.</li>
        <li>Adapt pacing and content based on how you respond, ensuring you’re challenged but never overwhelmed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tutoring Format</h3>
      <p>
        Lessons are offered both <strong>online</strong> and <strong>in‑person</strong>. Online sessions are conducted via
        video conferencing with interactive whiteboard software and screen sharing for
        collaborative working. For local students in the Crowthorne area I’m happy to
        travel to your home or meet at a mutually convenient location. I also provide
        digital notes and homework assignments after each session.
      </p>

      <h3>Student Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        Students I’ve tutored have gone on to achieve outstanding results, including
        significant grade improvements at GCSE and A‑Level. Many have described how my
        lessons helped them gain confidence and enjoy a subject they previously found
        daunting. While each learner’s journey is unique, my goal is always the same:
        to help you realise your potential in maths.
      </p>

      <h3>Free Consultation</h3>
      <p>
        Choosing a tutor is an important decision. That’s why I offer a no‑obligation
        30‑minute consultation. During this meeting we’ll discuss your current
        challenges, clarify your goals, go through a short sample lesson and decide how
        best to move forward. It’s a great opportunity to see if my teaching style
        suits you before committing to full sessions.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:1rem;">
        If you have any questions or would like to schedule your free consultation,
        please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>.
